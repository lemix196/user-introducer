# User introducer - React.js single page app
<p style='text-align:justify'>My first application coded in <b>React.js + CSS Modules</b>, completly by myself. It allows to pass Username and his/hers Age through <b>UserForm</b> and create <b>UserList</b>.</p>

# Passing data to UserForm

<br />
<p style='text-align:justify'>After typing in the form data clicking on Add user button (or by pressing Enter) the form data is passed to UserList component (the one with "No users added" heading) and updated. The header changes to "Users list:" and first user name with his age is added to the list. Also the form fields are cleared and ready to add next user:</p>

# Form data validation
<p style='text-align:justify'>Both fields have implemented two simple validators:
</p>

1) Username validator **does not allow to provide empty name** - when empty name is passed modal window pops-up:

2) Age validator **does not allow to pass empty field and values below 1**:

# Summary
That small app uses whole basics of React.js module and was a decent test of the React knowledge I gained hitherto. It also helped me to rust away my CSS skills and create maybe not so artistic, yet eye friendly UI.
